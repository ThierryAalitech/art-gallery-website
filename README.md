# Art Gallery Website Project 📂

## Overview
- Art Gallery Website is a 2-page responsive [website](https://github.com/ThierryAalitech/art-gallery-website#run) built with **HTML** &amp; **CSS**.
- This project is an [AmaliTech Ghana](https://www.amalitech.org) graduate trainee program assignment. 

## Description
  - The web pages are designed as follows:
  1. Home page 
      - a hero section to welcome users with an interactive link button to the location page.
      - Pictures of gallery halls in the main section. 
      - A footer with details about working hours and interactive social media icons.
  2. Location page
      - An embedded map window with location of the gallery and an interactive link button that 
        returns the user to the homepage.
      - A text section with location details in text.
      - A footer with details about working hours and interactive social media icons.

### Design Template

## Run
- The website resources are hosted and deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).
- Open this link [Modern Art Gallery](https://art-gallery-web.netlify.app/index.html) to view it in your browser.

### Modifications &amp; Suggestions
1. The initial design files used CSS media queries to get static images of the location. - However, to improve responsiveness and user experience we opted to use an embedded Google maps frame.
    - The navigation link buttons can be designed to stick to the top of the page when scrolling
