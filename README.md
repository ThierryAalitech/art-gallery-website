# Art Gallery Website Project 📂

## Overview
- Art Gallery Website is a 2-page responsive [website](https://github.com/ThierryAalitech/art-gallery-website#run) built with **HTML** &amp; **CSS**.
- This project is an [AmaliTech Ghana](https://www.amalitech.org) graduate trainee assignment. 

## Description
  - The web pages are designed as follows:
  1. Home page 
      - a hero section to welcome users with an interactive link button to the location page.
      - Pictures of gallery halls in the main section. 
      - A footer with details about working hours and interactive social media icons.
  2. Location page
      - An embedded map window with location of the gallery and an interactive link button that 
        returns the user to the home page.
      - A text section with location details in text.
      - A footer with details about working hours and interactive social media icons.

### Design Template
![Design Template](./assets/preview.jpg)

## Run
- The website resources are hosted and deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).
- Open this link [Modern Art Gallery](https://art-gallery-web.netlify.app/index.html) to view the website.
- To visit the website on another device, enter this address ```https://art-gallery-web.netlify.app/index.html``` in the browser.

  ##### Modifications &amp; Suggestions
     - The initial design used CSS media queries to get static images of the location map. However, to improve the user interaction and user experience we opted to use           an embedded Google maps frame.
     -  The navigation link buttons can be adjusted to stick to the top of the page when scrolling.
     -  A contact number or email can be included in the footer.
